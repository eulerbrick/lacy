# lacy
lacy is a simple webtool for text transliteration between the latin and cyrillic alphabets.\
latin - la ... cyrillic - cy ... lacy :)

It was specifically developed for the Institute of Slavic Studies at the University of Potsdam, and therefore adheres to their\
preferred transliteration guide. [https://slavistik.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/slavistik/Mitarbeiter/Buncic/translit.pdf]\
